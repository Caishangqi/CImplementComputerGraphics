## Overview

This project will use C# and C++ to implement certain computer graphics techniques while utilizing the WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) framework to apply them. The project is closely related to the engine project [Eurekiel](https://github.com/Caishangqi/Eurekiel), as the engine already provides 2D rendering with OpenGL and its associated functionalities.
